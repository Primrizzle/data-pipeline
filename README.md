# data-pipeline

## Prime Product Analyzer 

This project aims to develop a Python-based data pipeline that accesses real-time ecommerce data from an Amazon API available on RapidAPI.com. The pipeline will extract data related to product search optimization and other relevant ecommerce metrics, process this data for analysis, and provide actionable insights that can inform product positioning and sales strategies on Amazon.
